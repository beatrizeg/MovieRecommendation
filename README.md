# MovieRecommendation
The goal of this project is to use different Machine Learning algorithms to try to predict the rating that an user will give to a movie. 
To achieve this, we will use the Machine Learning models and statistics that we have learnt during the Data Science course and we will finally choose the one that gets the minimum RMSE number.
The dataset is allocated in http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip and has been pre-processed to achieve the movielens dataset
